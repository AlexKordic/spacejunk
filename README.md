## Space Junk

An app to view satellites with decaying orbits.

#### Design considerations

I just wanted to mess around in d3.js with a fun data set. In an effort to limit the amount of math being done on the front-end, I chose to visualize all orbits with zero eccentricity.

#### Future possible TODOs:

* Finish prediction visualization
* Add clock and list of satellites
* automate data gathering
* Possibly move to Three.js/WebGL
